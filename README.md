# Open G2P Docker

This repo dockerizes OpenG2P ERP.

“OpenG2P” is a set of digital building blocks opensourced to support large scale cash
transfer programs digitize key cogs in their delivery chain: 1) beneficiary targeting
and enrollment, 2) beneficiary list management, 3) payment digitization, and 4)
recourse.

The CRM provides an interface with rich set of tools for managing beneficiaries,
payments, complaints, and more. It is built on the OCB port of Odoo

## Installation on Kubernetes Cluster

- Install the helm chart given in the current directory.
  ```
  cd helm;
  helm dependency update
  helm install openg2p-erp . -n <NS>
  ```
- Give Superuser and create pg_trgm extension:
  ```
  kubectl exec -it openg2p-erp-postgresql-0 -n <NS> -- bash -c 'PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql -U postgres -d openg2p -c "alter role openg2p superuser;"; PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql -U postgres -d openg2p -c "create extension pg_trgm;"'
  ```
- Login in to ERP after installation;
  - In Settings -> General Settings -> Activate Developer Mode (on right side)
  - Back In Apps -> "Update App List" on top bar -> Update
  - Later in the Apps section; remove "Apps" search filter, then search and install "ODK Connector" module.
  - After above installation (keep checking logs), then search and install "OpenG2P Packaging" module.
  - After above, navigate to "Beneficiaries" app. Then click on "Configuration" -> "Identifications". Create new Identification with
    - Code: `taxid`
    - ID Name: `Tax ID`
- Note: if the ERP pod is ever killed, it will fail to reinitialize. The helm chart has to be reinstalled in that case.

## Using in Production

The following method is obsolete. Install using the above helm chart.

### Get the Code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenG2P/openg2p-crm-docker.git
cd openg2p-crm-docker
```

### Adding secrets

To boot this environment, these files must be present before you run docker-compose:

- `./.docker/odoo.env` must define `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- `./.docker/db-access.env` must define `PGPASSWORD`.
- `./.docker/db-creation.env` must define `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (must be equal to
  `PGPASSWORD` above).
- `./.docker/smtp.env` (OPTIONAL) must define `RELAY_PASSWORD` (password to access the
  real SMTP relay). Only if you are using backups
- `./.docker/backup.env` (OPTIONAL) must define `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (obtained from S3 provider) and `PASSPHRASE` (to encrypt
  backup archives). Only if you are using backups

Use the provided example docker-example folder and set your passwords as explained above

```bash
mv dot-docker-example .docker
```

### Booting production

Once secrets are in place start the
[reverse proxy](faq.md#how-to-bootstrap-the-global-inverse-proxy), that boots
[traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/).

```bash
docker-compose -p inverseproxy -f inverseproxy-none-ssl.yaml up -d
```

@TODO - Need to document how the SSL variant can be used

Then run the docker.

```bash
docker-compose -f prod.yaml up -d
```

If installing for the first time, you will need to initialize the database

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo --stop-after-init -i openg2p
```

Point your browwer to http://domain and log in with the default credentails:

username: `admin` password: `admin`

Change your password immediately after [login](#)!

### Backups

Backups are only available in the production environment. They are provided by
[tecnativa/duplicity:postgres-s3](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-duplicity). The
structure of the backed up folder:

```
├── prod.sql
└── odoo/
    ├── addons/
    └── filestore/
        └── prod/
            ├── ...
            └── ...
```

To make backup immediatly execute following command:

```sh
# Executes all jobs scheduled for daily run.
# With default configuration it's equal to making full backup
docker-compose exec backup /etc/periodic/daily/jobrunner
```

To restore backup:

```sh
# stop odoo if it's running
docker-compose stop odoo

# start backup and db
docker-compose up -d backup

# switch to some version
docker-compose exec backup restore --time TIME_IN_BACKUP_NAME --force

# ⚠️ DELETE PRODUCTION database
#docker-compose backup dropdb

# create new empty database
docker-compose exec backup createdb

# restore database
docker-compose exec backup sh -c 'psql -f $SRC/$PGDATABASE.sql'

# start odoo
docker-compose up -d
```

### Updating

To pull in updates to the CRM run

```bash
docker-compose -f prod.yaml build --pull  # Updates your image
docker-compose -f prod.yaml run --rm odoo odoo --stop-after-init -u base  # Updates addons
docker-compose -f prod.yaml up -d
```

## Developing with OpenG2P CRM Docker

⚠️ DO NOT USE THIS METHOD IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS ⚠️

### Install the dependencies

If installing for development, you will need the following tools installed:

- [copier][] v3.0.6 or newer
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) 2.24 or newer
- [invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) installed in Python 3.6+ (and the binary must be
  called `invoke` — beware if your distro installs it as `invoke3` or similar).
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+

Install non-python apps with your distro's recommended package manager. The recommended
way to install Python CLI apps is [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install copier
pipx install invoke
pipx install pre-commit
pipx ensurepath
```

### Getting Starting

Clone or Download the repository to your target machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenG2P/openg2p-crm-docker.git
```

Get the OpenG2P CRM code with:

```bash
invoke git-aggregate
invoke img-build --pull
```

Initialize a database:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo --stop-after-init -i openg2p
```

Above will by default use `devel.yaml` if installing for production please use
`prod.yaml`

Start OpenG2P with:

```bash
invoke start
```

List other tasks shipped with this project:

```bash
invoke --list
```

Clean out project if we invoked git-aggregate or used setup-devel.yaml. Run this before
git add

```bash
git clean -ffd
```

To browse OpenG2P go to `http://localhost:12069` and log in with the default
credentails:

username: `admin` password: `admin`

### Updating

```bash
git pull
invoke git-aggregate
invoke img-build --pull
docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo --stop-after-init -u base  # Updates your database
docker-compose -f up -d
```

### MailHog

We use [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to provide a fake SMTP server that
intercepts all mail sent by OpenG2P and displays a simple interface that lets you see
and debug all that mail comfortably, including headers sent, attachments, etc.

- For [development][], it's in http://localhost:8025
- For [testing][], it's in http://$DOMAIN_TEST/smtpfake/
- For [production][], it's not used.

All environments are configured by default to use the bundled SMTP relay. They are
configured by these environment variables:

- `SMTP_SERVER`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`
- `SMTP_SSL`
- `EMAIL_FROM`

For them to be useful, you need to remove any `ir.mail_server` records in your database.

### Network isolation

The Docker network is in `--internal` mode, which means that it has no access to the
Internet. This feature protects you in cases where a [production][] database is restored
and OpenG2P tries to connect to SMTP/IMAP/POP3 servers to send or receive emails. Also
when you are using [connectors](https://github.com/OCA/connector),
[mail trackers](https://www.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?search=mail_tracking) or any
API sync/calls.

If you still need to have public access, set `internal: false` in the environment file,
detach all containers from that network, remove the network, reatach all containers to
it, and possibly restart them. You can also just do:

```bash
docker-compose down
invoke start
```

Usually a better option is
[whitelisting](faq.md#how-can-i-whitelist-a-service-and-allow-external-access-to-it).

### wdb

[`wdb`](https://github.com/Kozea/wdb/) is one of the greatest Python debugger available,
and even more for Docker-based development, so here you have it preinstalled.

To use it, write this in any Python script:

```python
import wdb
wdb.set_trace()
```

It's available by default on the [development][] environment, where you can browse
http://localhost:1984 to use it.

**⚠️ DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS ⚠️** (I had to say it).

### Testing

A good rule of thumb is test in testing before uploading to production, so this
environment tries to imitate the [production][] one in everything, but _removing
possible pollution points_:

- It has [a fake `smtp` service based on MailHog](#mailhog), just like development.

- It has no `backup` service.

- It is [isolated](#network-isolation).

To use it, you need to [add secrets files just like for production](#adding-secrets),
although secrets for smtp and backup containers are not needed because those don't exist
here. Also, start
[the global inverse proxy](faq.md#how-to-bootstrap-the-global-inverse-proxy) before
running the test environment.

Test it in your machine with:

```bash
docker-compose -f test.yaml up -d
```

#### Global whitelist

Since the testing environment is [network-isolated](#network-isolation), this can change
some deadlocks or big timeouts in code chunks that are not ready for such situation.
OpenG2P happens to have some of them.

The [development][] environment includes the default recommended whitelist proxies, but
for [testing][], it is recommended to have a separate docker compose project running
along in the same server that provides a `globalwhitelist_default` network where all
whitelist proxies exist. This is a better practice for a testing environment where many
services might coexist, because it will let you save lots of processing power and IP
addresses.

### Reseting

At times we find ourselves having to blow away docker and start from scratch. Only use
the command below if you know what you are doing as it blows away all the volumes and
images on your edockerngine.

```bash
./scripts/docker_blow_away.sh
```

@TODO (limit the above to only openg2p crm)

## Other usage scenarios

In examples below I will skip the `-f <environment>.yaml` part and assume you know which
environment you want to use.

Also, we recommend to use `run` subcommand to create a new container with same settings
and volumes. Sometimes you may prefer to use `exec` instead, to execute an arbitrary
command in a running container.

### Inspect the database

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo psql
```

### Restart OpenG2P

You will need to restart it whenever any Python code changes, so to do that:

```bash
docker-compose restart odoo
```

In development mode odoo restarts by itself thanks to `--dev=reload` option.

### Run unit tests for some addon

```bash
modules=addon1,addon2
# Install their dependencies first
docker-compose run --rm odoo addons init --dependencies $modules
# Test them at install
docker-compose run --rm odoo addons init --test $modules
# Test them again at update
docker-compose run --rm odoo addons update --test $modules
```

\* Note: This replaces the old deprecated `unittest` script.

### Reading the logs

For all services in the environment:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f --tail 10
```

Only OpenG2P's:

```bash
docker-compose cc
```

### Install some addon without stopping current running process

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo -i addon1,addon2 --stop-after-init
```

### Update some addon without stopping current running process

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo -u addon1,addon2 --stop-after-init
```

### Update changed addons only

Just run:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo click-odoo-update --watcher-max-seconds 30
```

This script is part of [`click-odoo-contrib`][]; check it for more details.

\* Note: `--watcher-max-seconds` is available because we ship a
[patched](https://github.com/acsone/click-odoo-contrib/pull/38) version. Check that PR
for docs.

\* Note: This replaces the old deprecated `autoupdate` script.

### Export some addon's translations to stdout

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo pot addon1[,addon2]
```

Now copy the relevant parts to your `addon1.pot` file.

### Open an odoo shell

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo shell
```

### Open another UI instance linked to same filestore and database

```bash
docker-compose run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:$SomeFreePort:8069 odoo
```

Then open `http://localhost:$SomeFreePort`.
